# Data Science Training – Problem Set 01 (R)

This repository contains a set of introductory R exercises focused on basic data manipulation, logical operations, vectors, datasets, and plotting.

## Overview

The script demonstrates fundamental R concepts, including:

* Creating integer variables and performing logical comparisons
* Inspecting the class of existing R objects
* Working with numeric vectors
* Exploring built-in datasets
* Producing plots using the Iris dataset
* Performing vectorized arithmetic operations
* Retrieving structural information from datasets

## Exercises Description

**1. Logical Comparison**
Creates two integer variables (`Ana` and `Paulo`) representing ages and performs a logical test to determine who is older.

**2. Object Class Inspection**
Checks the class of the built-in `BOD` dataset.

**3. Vector Operations**
Creates a numeric vector from 1 to 10 and demonstrates vector handling.

**4. Dataframe Exploration**
Prints the last 10 rows of the built-in `women` dataset.

**5. Data Visualization**
Generates a scatter plot using selected attributes from rows 50 to 100 of the `iris` dataset.

**6. Vectorized Addition**
Creates two vectors of equal size, performs element-wise addition, and prints the result.

**7. Dataset Structure Inspection**
Displays the number of rows, columns, row names, and column names of the `CO2` dataset.

## Requirements

* R (version 4.0 or later recommended)
* RStudio (optional, but recommended)

## Running the Code

Clone the repository and run the R script:

```r
source("script_name.R")
```

or execute the code blocks directly in RStudio.

## Purpose

This project is intended for beginners learning the fundamentals of R programming and basic data science operations using built-in datasets.
